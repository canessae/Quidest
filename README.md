### QuidEst: Real-Time Monocular Depth Map to Sound Conversion System

’QuidEst’ is an algorithm that associates ’spatial sounds’ to specific areas within a video frame in order to locate in real-time the presence of (moving) obstacles from the surroundings (e.g., while walking or cycling) to then send a ring alarm according to its proximity.

For further details on options, etc see ["User's Manual"](https://github.com/canessae/Quidest/blob/main/Quidest-UserManual-v1.pdf)

#### Binaries

The latest version of the Debian ’QuidEst-x.x.x-Linux.deb’ package can be downloaded from 
["Releases"](https://github.com/canessae/Quidest/releases)

#### Requirements

The minimum HW needed to test QuidEst is any standard PC Computer e.g., Intel Core i5, 64bit and at least 4G RAM, running a recent release of Linux O.S. (23.04LT or newer) having an internal webcam. Other optional HW can be an external USB webcam, audio stereo speakers, or headphones and a smartphone with the free DroidCam app installed (as shown below).

#### QuidEst in Action 

QuidEst allows to associate in real-time 9 musical notes to 9 specific areas in a video frame in order to send stereo acustic warnings due to the presence of (front or rear) moving obstacles in the surroundings:
